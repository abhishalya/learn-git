## Cherry-picking commits

One of the other most useful features of git. This one is my favourite one.
As we are all humans, we all make mistakes of variable complexity. This is
where this tool comes handy. Many times, someone create some good commits but
mess up other in his PR and this only causes chaos. If the commit is important
we need that merged but due to other bad commits in the PR we couldn't.

So, the option is to chery-pick that commit and push it or include it in one of
other PR along with better commits. This is also useful in other scenarios where
we need the things from different PRs to combine and see their result at once.

So, lets get started with this!

I'm here creating a new PR on a new branch and I will cherry-pick some other
commit into this one, and will see how that looks like. I'll also merge this PR
and will note that if the other open PR gets merged or not. git is powerful,
you'll surely know this in this example.
