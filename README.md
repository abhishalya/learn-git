# Learn git

[![Build Status][travis-logo]][travis-build]

Since we heavily rely on git, we need to learn and understand each and every
command & features of the git. This repo is specially meant for me and everyone
who needs to test the features of git without worrying too much about anything.
This provides a free environment for the users who are new to git and need some
training before they can continue their open-source journey.

I will also be helping all of the people who are stuck with some of the things
related to git. So, get started now! I will be updating the README to provide
more details on the commands and various tasks which we can do with the power
of git.

So, get started now! :tada:
